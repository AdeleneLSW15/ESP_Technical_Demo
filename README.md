# ESP_Technical_Demo

In Embedded Systems Project, technical demonstration criteria is assessed. Based on the task achieved, the score will be logged and taken into account to the unit grade result.

- TD1: Assess whether your buggy is able to perform basic Motor Control.
- TD2: Assess sensors for your project. Sensors does not have to be fitted to the buggy.
- TD3: Assess autonomous white-line following control capability of your buggy - Steering. 
- TD4: Assess autonomous white-line following buggy on mini race track. Make the buggy robust.

Additionally, I have also created debugging code files that test out initial features of sensors, getting proportional constant values and more.
